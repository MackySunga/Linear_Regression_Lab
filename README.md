# Linear_Regression_Lab
Interactive, offline-first linear regression lab: CSV → scatterplot, adjustable line + error band, OLS reference, diagnostics, and outlier detection.

This project is a teaching-oriented web app for building intuition about linear regression. Students can upload a CSV, plot a scatter, and interactively adjust slope and intercept while the app computes MSE, R², and an OLS reference line. It supports color/symbol encodings to reveal clusters, central-tendency and dispersion tables, label frequencies, and multiple outlier modes (residual, IQR box, custom gate). Everything runs locally in the browser—no backend—so it’s privacy-friendly and easy to host on GitHub Pages or offline in the classroom.
